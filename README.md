### What is InstaVip?
[**InstaVip**](https://github.com/RozhakXD/InstaVip) is a script to get followers, likes and comments on Instagram accounts using the help of the [**Vipig.net**](https://vipig.net) website, this script only functions to generate coins automatically. Before you exchange coins for followers you are also required to have enough coins or by doing missions to follow accounts randomly.

### Termux command?
First you must have the [Termux](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_118.apk) application to run this tool and for how to use it can be seen on [**Youtube**](https://youtu.be/ZE4qk92wpuU). Then you enter some basic commands below!
```
$ apt update -y && apt upgrade -y
$ pkg install git python-pip
$ git clone https://github.com/RozhakXD/InstaVip
$ cd "InstaVip"
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python Run.py
```

```
$ cd "$HOME/InstaVip" && git pul
$ python Run.py
```

### When will the followers, likes, and comments arrive?
You can wait one to seven days. The process depends on the number of Vipig website users or not, Further problems usually occur because you enter the wrong username or posting link.

### Terms of exchanging coins?

- For video reels, replace **"reels"** with **"p"**. Example : **https://www.instagram.com/reels/Ctgu3koJOrl/** > **https://www.instagram.com/p/Ctgu3koJOrl/**
- Make sure the posting link is correct and the account is unlocked.
- To exchange to followers your Instagram account cannot be locked or private.

### What if the account is blocked?

- Don't use the account you just created, if you want to keep using it, you can wait 1-3 days.
- Use a delay of more than 60 seconds.
- Make sure the account is equipped with two-factor authentication, email, and phone number.
- Don't overcook the account to continue working on the mission, it's best to rest for a few hours so that the Instagram account is safe.

### Didn't get coins?
Every 8 missions following success you will get around 18k - 19k coins, if not fulfilled maybe the mission on the Vipig website is running out or your Instagram account has reached the mission limit.

**Solution :**
- Do the mission at night around 18.00 - 22.00.
- Change Instagram account cookies.
- Quit doing missions try again tomorrow.

### Instagram account configuration requirements?

- Vietnamese account name (not really needed), for example : **Nguyễn Văn**.
- First the account must have a profile photo.
- Account must have at least one follower.
- Post at least one photo (to prevent the account from being detected as spam).

### Don't want to swap automatically?
Please enter @username if you have chosen number one, for example: @rozhak_official *This method works so that your coins don't automatically exchange to followers.
